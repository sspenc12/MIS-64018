Repository for projects and assignments related to MIS-64018: Quantitative Management Modeling

Assignment 1-1:

This assignment goals were to get acquainted with R, RStudio, Github, and create a small R Script to show basic comprehension of RStudio commands and functionality.

Assignment 1-2:

This assignment's goal was to familiarize ourselves with the thought process and problem formulation involved in linear programming. The example problem focuses on an imaginary company that wishes to maximize profits of backpack sales based on several material, labor, and sales constraints.

Assignment 2:

The goal of this assignment was further practice the process of outlining a linear programming problem. In addition to that, we graphically solved one program to find the optimum solution based on decision variables and constraints. With a more complex problem, we used RStudio and the "lpSolveAPI" library to frame the problem in R and solve for the optimum solution.

Assignment 3:

The goal of this assignment was to perform additional analysis on the output of Assignment 2 via post-optimality functions. This included a look at the shadow prices, dual solutions, and reduced costs. Additionally, this involved practice with forumlating the dual problem and solving it in RStudio with the "lpSolveAPI" library.

Assignment 4:

The goal of this assignment was to formulate and solve transportation problems given various supply and demand constraints. Additionally, the assignment included practice with creating network diagrams to visualize the connections between plants and warehouses.
