# MIS-64018
Repository for projects and assignments related to MIS-64018: Quantitative Management Modeling

Assignment 1-1:

This assignment goals were to get acquainted with R, RStudio, Github, and create a small R Script to show basic comprehension of RStudio commands and functionality.

Assignment 1-2:

This assignment's goal was to familiarize ourselves with the thought process and problem formulation involved in linear programming. The example problem focuses on an imaginary company that wishes to maximize profits of backpack sales based on several material, labor, and sales constraints.

Assignment 2:

The goal of this assignment was further practice the process of outlining a linear programming problem. In addition to that, we graphically solved one program to find the optimum solution based on decision variables and constraints. With a more complex problem, we used RStudio and the "lpSolveAPI" library to frame the problem in R and solve for the optimum solution.

Assignment 3:

The goal of this assignment was to perform additional analysis on the output of Assignment 2 via post-optimality functions. This included a look at the shadow prices, dual solutions, and reduced costs. Additionally, this involved practice with forumlating the dual problem and solving it in RStudio with the "lpSolveAPI" library.

Assignment 4:

The goal of this assignment was to formulate and solve transportation problems given various supply and demand constraints. Additionally, the assignment included practice with creating network diagrams to visualize the connections between plants and warehouses.

Assignment 5:

The goal of this assignment was to formulate and solve integer programming problems. The first part of the assignment focused on a project network with various paths and defining what the longest, critical path was. The second part of the assignment presented an investment portfolio with various restrictions by the client. The goal was to maximize the return on investment while meeting the critera. Additionally, it looked at the difference between adding and removing integer restrictions to problems.

Assignment 6:

The goal of this assignment was to become more familiar with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and goal programming. The DEA problem focused on solving a problem with two inputs and outputs via DEA and all the different assumptions (FDH, CRS, VRS, IRS, DRS, and FRH/ADD. Lastly, it involved returning the lambda and peer values for each method and comparing the results between each method. The goal programming problem involved defining an objective function for a company that is impacted by different weights for exceeding or underachieving target goals. The output of the formulated linear programming model was reviewed to make business sense of the output.

Assignment 7:

The goal of this assignment was to choose a problem in a particular industry and apply linear programming to outline a solution. The milk industry was chosen for this project. Specifically, the change in inventory stocking levels for different types of cow milk and plant-based milks. There is a consistent decrease in cow's milk demanda and increase in plant-based milk demand. Therefore, retailers, distributors, and farmers need to realize the impact on their stocking levels and supply levels to avoid overproducing and wasting milk.
